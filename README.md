# Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing(NLP): IMDb Sentiment Analysis using RNN, GRU, and LSTM.

This project utilizes deep learning techniques, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDb dataset.
The goal is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on the text content. The models are trained on a subset of the IMDb dataset and evaluated for accuracy. 
Additionally, the project includes functionalities for preprocessing text data, building and training deep learning models, and evaluating model performance.
Evaluated new data using the top-performing model, the GRU, which accurately predicted sentiment.
